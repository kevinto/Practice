# Problem 1.3

## Problem Statement:
**URLify:** Write a method to replace all apces in a string with '%20'. You may assume tha tthe string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that oyu can perform this operation in place.)

Example:
Input: "Mr  John  Smith    ", 13
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith", 13
