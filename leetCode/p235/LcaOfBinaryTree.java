 *
 * Problem: Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA)
 *          of two given nodes in the BST.
 *
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is
 * defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w
 * as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 *
 * 1. Do i need to optimize for space or time?
 *
 * Initial solution:
